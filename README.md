# 9 Compartmental CO2 Model

**Project Title**: Algorithmic Correction of Physiological Variables in Diverse Angles and Compartmental CO2 Estimation

**Project Duration**: September 2021 - June 2022

**Affiliation**: New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ – Vestibular Autonomic Lab, funded by the Naval Nuclear Laboratory

**Overview**:
During my tenure with the New Jersey Medical School’s Vestibular Autonomic Lab, I spearheaded the development of innovative algorithms designed to enhance the accuracy of physiological measurements in medical research. This project, conducted under the guidance of a PhD student and supported by a grant from the Naval Nuclear Laboratory, involved creating sophisticated computational models that adjusted physiological variables for varied conditions and estimated gaseous exchange parameters in lung compartments.

**Objectives**:
This research aimed to develop a robust algorithmic framework that could correct blood pressure measurements for body angle variations and estimate the oxygen content across different lung compartments. A critical component of this work was adapting a model based on J. Gisolf et al.’s study (2003), which examined how physiological variables like tidal volume and cardiac output influence CO2 levels during postural changes.

**Technical Contributions**:
1. **Angle Adjustment Algorithm**: I developed an algorithm capable of adjusting systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings based on the subject’s body angle relative to gravity. This tool helps maintain accuracy in blood pressure measurements under diverse physiological conditions, ensuring reliable data for further analysis.

2. **Oxygen Estimation in Lung Compartments**: Leveraging the framework from the Gisolf et al. study, I tailored an algorithm to estimate oxygen distribution in the nine lung compartments. This involved complex mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to estimate oxygen levels, which are vital for assessing pulmonary function.

3. **CO2 Estimation Model**: Another significant contribution was creating a numeric model for approximating the CO2 concentration per lung compartment. This model utilized end-tidal CO2 measurements as a non-invasive surrogate to estimate the compartment-specific CO2 levels, thereby enabling labs lacking specialized equipment to assess pulmonary gas exchange effectively.

**Challenges and Innovations**:
- Adaptation of existing scientific models (e.g., Gisolf et al., 2003) to a new demographic and set of conditions, accounting for potential variances in physiological responses.
- Estimation of Stroke Volume Per Breath using the Liljestrand & Zander formula required careful calibration to minimize inaccuracies due to methodological constraints.

**Impact and Applications**:
The algorithms developed during this project refine the accuracy of physiological measurements at various body angles and facilitate detailed lung compartment analysis without the need for direct measurement equipment. This capability is crucial for advancing research in respiratory physiology and can significantly benefit studies in clinical settings where resource limitations might restrict the availability of advanced diagnostic tools.

**Future Research Directions**:
This work opens avenues for further refinement of physiological measurement techniques and their application in clinical research, potentially extending to studies involving dynamic physical activities where angle and pressure variations are pronounced. Continuing to build on this foundational work could also lead to more personalized approaches in patient care and monitoring.
